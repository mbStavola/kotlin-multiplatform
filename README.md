# Kotlin Multiplatform
Example library for portable Kotlin.

## What is this?
This is an experiment in making a Kotlin library that can be used in JVM, JS, and Native modes.

We'll start by making naive implementations of some common data structures in pure Kotlin. This guarantees our library can be run on any platform.

After that, we explore by swapping out internals and adding extra functionality to these libraries per platform.
